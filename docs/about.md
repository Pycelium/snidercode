# About Me

Hi, I'm **Jay Snider** (@Pycelium on GitHub) — an electronics calibration technician who decided to learn the ways of a full-stack developer.

I study 1–2 hours every day, consistently.  
This site is my public log of everything I learn: the wins, the bugs, the “why did that take 4 hours” moments, and every project I ship.

**Background**  
- Degree in Electronic & Computer Engineering Technology</br>
- Technician Class Amateur Radio Licensed   
- 20+ years tinkering with hardware  
- Now obsessed with Python, Django, and building things people actually may find useful

Stick around — let’s build this together.
