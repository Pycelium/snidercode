# Welcome to SniderCode

I'm a 43-year-old ECET graduate self-learning to code 1–2 hours every day.

This site documents my progress and provides me with a sense of accountability.

My main aim is to produce robust, resilient and reliable code.

Consistent effort is my main method.


Currently learning: Python → Basics via the book: Python Crash Course
