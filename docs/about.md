# About Me

Hi, I'm **Jay Snider** (@Pycelium on GitHub) — a 43-year-old electronics engineer who decided to become a full-stack developer.

I study 1–2 hours every single day, no excuses.  
This site is my public log of everything I learn: the wins, the bugs, the “why did that take 4 hours” moments, and every project I ship.

**Background**  
- Degree in Electronics Engineering  
- 20+ years tinkering with hardware  
- Now obsessed with Python, Django, and building things people actually use

**Goal**  
Go from zero to paid freelance / remote dev job in 2026.

Stick around — let’s build this together.
