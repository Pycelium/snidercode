# Week 1 – Python Basics

This week I officially started my coding journey with **Python Crash Course** (3rd edition) by Eric Matthes.

### What I Learned
- How to install Python and set up VS Code
- Variables and basic data types (`str`, `int`, `float`, `bool`)
- String methods: `.upper()`, `.title()`, `.strip()`
- f-strings (my new best friend)
- Lists: creating, indexing, appending, and slicing
- Basic `for` loops and the `range()` function
